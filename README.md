# Reinforcement Learning 2018
## Programming Assignment

TODO: 
- [] wrapper that models the LunarLander-v2 environment, 
- [] agent that learns how to solve it (remember: the LunarLander-v2 environment is considered ‘solved’ as soon as you get a total reward of at least 200 in an episode).
- [] experiments
- [] report

# Goal
The goal is for you to implement a Reinforcement Learning algorithm and wrapper of your choice.
